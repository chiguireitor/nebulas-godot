Nebulas-Godot
====

A Godot 3.2+ compatible module to enable your games to use Nebulas-powered tokens and smart contracts.

Done with funding thanks to [Go Nebulas project 293](https://go.nebulas.io/project/293), a proposal created by the Nebulas community to further the Nebulas reach into gaming.

Usage
==

The `Nebulas` class contains all the necessary methods to create addresses, transactions and contract calls on Nebulas. An example wallet manager Singleton is included in the `scripts` directory.

Precompiled binaries can be found in the Nebulas site. If you need to use additional modules follow the next paragraph.

Copy the `modules` and `thirdparty` directories into your Godot build directory. Build following Godot's guides.
